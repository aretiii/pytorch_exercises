# pytorch_exercises
This repository contains exercises and examples from the PyTorch beginner tutorials. The goal is to provide hands-on practice with core PyTorch concepts, starting from basic tensors to more advanced topics like data handling and image transformations.

1. Tensors:

This section introduces PyTorch tensors, including:

  Creating and manipulating tensors.
  
  Basic operations like addition, multiplication, and reshaping.
  
  Use cases in machine learning.

2. Datasets and DataLoaders:
   
Learn how to:

  Use built-in datasets like FashionMNIST.
  
  Create custom datasets from CSV files.
  
  Load data efficiently using DataLoader.

3. Transforms:

Focus on image transformations:

  Resizing, cropping, and normalizing images.
  
  Writing custom transformations (e.g., horizontal flip).
  
  Composing multiple transformations.

How to Use: 
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git  

Open the relevant .py file or Jupyter notebook for each topic.

Follow the code examples and customize them for your own learning.
