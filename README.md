# pytorch_exercises
This repository contains exercises and examples from the PyTorch beginner tutorials. The goal is to provide hands-on practice with core PyTorch concepts, starting from basic tensors to more advanced topics like data handling and image transformations.

1. Tensors:


  Creating and manipulating tensors.
  
  Basic operations like addition, multiplication, and reshaping.
  
  Use cases in machine learning.

2. Datasets and DataLoaders:
   

  Use built-in datasets like FashionMNIST.
  
  Create custom datasets from CSV files.
  
  Load data efficiently using DataLoader.

3. Transforms:


  Resizing, cropping, and normalizing images.
  
  Writing custom transformations (e.g., horizontal flip).
  
  Composing multiple transformations.

4. Autograd:

  Compute gradients automatically for scalar and multivariable functions.
  
  Calculate Jacobian matrices and higher-order derivatives.
  
  Demonstrate gradient tracking and detachment.
  

How to Use: 

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git  

Open the relevant .py file or Jupyter notebook for each topic.

Follow the code examples and customize them for your own learning.
